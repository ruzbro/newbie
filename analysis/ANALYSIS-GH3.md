# Comprehensive Analysis of Greenhouse 3 Performance (Mar-May 2025)

This report provides an in-depth analysis of crop performance in Greenhouse 3 between March and May 2025. The analysis correlates harvest data with detailed hydroponics metrics to identify the key factors driving both success and failure.

## 1. Executive Summary

Greenhouse 3 (GH3) shows strong performance for several crops, particularly **Green Salanova Oakleaf** and **Romaine**, which consistently deliver high yields and revenue. However, a significant performance dip was observed from mid-April to late May, impacting most crops. The primary cause of this decline appears to be a sharp **increase in water temperature**, compounded by **suboptimal pH and EC levels**. Notably, **Romaine** demonstrated remarkable resilience, continuing to thrive even under these stressful conditions, suggesting a higher tolerance for heat and nutrient imbalances.

## 3. Analysis of Performance Trends

### A. Top Performing Periods (Early March - Mid-April)

The early spring period (weeks 10-15) was highly productive for GH3. Crops like `Baby Romaine`, `Green Salanova` varieties, and `Romaine` consistently exceeded their harvest targets.

**Favorable Conditions:**
The analysis of the hydroponics data during the growth cycles for these successful harvests reveals a stable and favorable environment:
- **Growing Average EC:** 1200 - 1350
- **Growing Average pH:** 5.7 - 6.5
- **Growing Average Water Temp:** 28째C - 29째C

These conditions are within the optimal ranges for lettuce cultivation and were clearly conducive to high yields.

### B. Performance Dip (Mid-April - Late May)

Starting around week 16, a noticeable decline in performance was observed across most crops. This trend continued until the end of May.

**Causal Factors:**
The investigation into the environmental conditions for the underperforming harvests during this period points to a combination of stressors:

1.  **Extreme Water Temperatures:** This appears to be the most critical factor. The average water temperature during the growing phase began to climb steadily, reaching **over 40째C in week 21** and a shocking **50째C+ in week 22**. These temperatures are severely detrimental to root health and nutrient uptake.
2.  **Low pH Levels:** The average pH during the growing cycle frequently dipped to **~5.6**. At this level, the availability of certain key nutrients to the plants is significantly reduced, likely hindering growth.
3.  **Low EC Levels:** The nutrient concentration (EC) also trended lower during this period, often falling into the **1150-1200 range**. This may have been insufficient to support robust growth, especially with the added temperature and pH stress.

This "perfect storm" of high water temperature, low pH, and low nutrient concentration created a highly unfavorable environment, leading to the widespread crop failures observed.

### C. The Resilient Performer: Romaine

In stark contrast to the other crops, `Romaine` not only survived the challenging conditions of late April and May but **continued to exceed its harvest targets**.

**Analysis of Romaine's Success:**
- `Romaine` was exposed to the **same harsh conditions** as the failing crops, including the extreme water temperatures and suboptimal pH/EC levels.
- Its ability to thrive under such stress suggests an **inherent genetic tolerance** to heat and nutrient imbalances that the other lettuce varieties lack.

This makes `Romaine` a standout crop, particularly valuable for its reliability during the hotter months.

## 4. Key Takeaways & Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Water Temperature Control:** The data unequivocally shows that the surge in water temperature was the most damaging factor. Investing in a more robust water cooling system for the hydroponics is critical to prevent future crop failures during warmer months.
2.  **Optimize Nutrient & pH Levels:** While temperature was the primary issue, maintaining optimal pH (6.0-6.5) and EC (1200-1400 for growing) levels is crucial. Tighter monitoring and automated adjustments can help ensure these stay within the ideal range.
3.  **Leverage High-Performing Cultivars:** `Green Salanova Oakleaf` is the clear top performer in terms of overall yield and revenue under optimal conditions. `Romaine` is the most resilient and reliable crop for warmer periods. Future planting schedules should capitalize on the strengths of these two varieties.
4.  **Re-evaluate Underperforming Crops:** Crops like `Red Batavia` consistently underperform in GH3. It would be wise to either replace them with more suitable varieties or conduct specific trials to determine the exact environmental recipe they need to succeed.
