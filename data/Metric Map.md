### Mapping of various hydroponics metrics in Hydronomics Monitoring Excel file
The metrics are arranged in columns by week with the week numbers in row 4. For example, the first week starts in column C identified by week number in cell C4. Using the mapping table below, we would find the first daily entry of week 1 of System EC (sys_ec) in C21, with the next day in D21, all the way to the 7th day of the week in C27. Furthermore, the data for the following week 2 will be located in column D starting at D21 to D27, week 3 in E21 to E27 and so forth until there are week numbers defined in row 4.T
